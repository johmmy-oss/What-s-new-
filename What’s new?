Office 2019 includes several key features that were previously available through Office 365. These features include improved inking capabilities, new PowerPoint animation features including morph and zoom features, and new Excel formulas and charts for data analysis. Office 2019 for Windows requires Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 or macOS Sierra. OneNote is absent from the suite because the UWP version of OneNote bundled within Windows 10 replaces it. OneNote 2016 can be installed as an optional feature in the Office 2019 installer. Office 2019 will receive five years of traditional support, but only two years of extended support.office.com/setup or microsoft.com
